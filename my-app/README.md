This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm cd my-app ## to go into the app directory
# and then,

npm i ## to install any and all dependencies 
# lastly,

npm run dev ## to start up the app
```


## After Starting App

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Creator Notes

The app might be slow running on a laptop or older computer due to the number of fetch requests.

If you have code errors then you should try: restarting your code editor, running npm i again
